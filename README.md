# Implementations of readability measures

1. Implementations of classic readability formulas
- [Flesch-Kincaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)
- [Dale-Chall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale%E2%80%93Chall_readability_formula)
- [Gunning-Fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index)
- [SMOG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG) ("Simple Measure Of Gobbledegook")

2. Using BERT to (badly) simulate measures that actually depend on empirical results:
- BERT for [cloze testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test) in this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jnO57doC-dXfJQT2Aj8HgVfLEAbFlkzS#scrollTo=RIegRz7RM0M6)

- Assigning text to elementary school grade levels
- Corpus is text labeled with grade levels 2-5. ** What corpus would be better than this for audience-specific readability? ** 

This paper reports POS analysis as among the strongest

"While pre-processing the texts, we found that many articles, especially those for lower grade levels, consist of only puzzles and quizzes, often in the form of simple multiple-choice questions. We discarded such texts"

Shallow Features:
average number of syllables per word
percentage of poly-syll. words per doc.
average number of poly-syll. words per sent.
average number of characters per word
Chall-Dale difficult words rate per doc.
average number of words per sentence
Flesch-Kincaid score
total number of words per document
